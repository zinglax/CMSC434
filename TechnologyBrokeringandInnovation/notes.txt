Technology Brokering and Innovation in a Product Development Firm
==============

Read the first 10 pages "Technology Brokering and Innovation in a Product Development Firm" by Hargadon and Sutton from the Administrative Science Quarterly, Dec 1997. On campus, it can be found here: http://umaryland.worldcat.org/oclc/90307324 (Links to an external site.). You can download or print a PDF. You must read pgs 716-725, but I encourage you to read the rest of the article as it is very good. Please answer the following questions:

1. What is a technology broker?

2. What does it mean to say that Edison's laboratory filled a "structural hole"?

3. What are the seven ways that the authors used to learn how IDEO innovates?

4. What are the rules of an IDEO brainstorming session?

5. What are the four steps of the technology brokering process?

6. Choose a design from Table 1 that, to you, is a clever mixing of ideas from different industries. Do a little Google research and report what you uncover about how the current state-of-the-art product is designed.

## 1. What is a technology broker?
__Technology Brokering__: is to span multiple, otherwise disconnected industries to see how existing technologies could be used to create breakthrough innovations in other markets.
- These are people who discovered bridges in emergent worlds and apply scientific concepts or processes to new situations or circumstances.

## 2. Edisons Library filling Structural Hole
__structural holes__:a gap in the flow of information between subgroups in a larger network
- Edison's gap existed between industries where there was and was not knowledge about the newly emerging electromagnetic tech's.
- Brokers who have come from one trade/technological breakthrough and transfer there skills to another. In Edisons case from the telephone industry to the Lighting, etc.

### Wikipedia 
The first examples of technology brokering can be found as early as 1876 with Thomas Edison in his Menlo Park laboratory. In six years, this lab procured over 400 patents.[4] Menlo Park laboratory was such a successful ‘invention factory’ because Thomas Edison had a firm belief in recombinant innovation. There were no inventions from Menlo Park that were truly invented from nothing

## 3. Seven Ways authors used to learn how IDEO Innovates
1. Tracking development Projects
2. Semistructured interviews with designers and managers
3. Informal Discussions
4. Brainstorming Sessions
5. Other Meetings
6. Design Team Interviews
7. Materials About The Organization 


# Notes
IDEO - product design firm

## Edisons lab
Social network theory suggests that Edison's laboratory
could innovate routinely because it occupied a "structural
hole" (Burt, 1992a, 1992b), a gap in the flow of information
between subgroups in a larger network. For Edison, these
gaps existed between industries where there was and was
not knowledge about the newly emerging electromagnetic
technologies. Actors filling these gaps are brokers who ben-
efit by transferring resources from groups where they are
plentiful to groups where they are dear (Marsden, 1982;
Gould and Fernandez, 1989; Burt, 1992a; DiMaggio, 1992).
Brokers have an advantage over competitors because "non-
redundant contacts are linked only through the central
player, [so brokers] are assured of being the first to see new
opportunities created by the needs in one group that could
be served by skills in another group" (Burt, 1992a: 70). Edi-
son's laboratory acted as a broker of technological ideas be-
cause it had connections to many industries, rather than be-
ing central in one, and it linked industries that had few other
ties (DiMaggio, 1992).
